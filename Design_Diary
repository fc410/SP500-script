I didn't really have a struggle; it was just more about learning a new library and seeing what it could do. The library that
stood out and used the most was the pandas library and matplotlib for graphs. This project was actually really fun to work on
because I got to work with stocks, I had always wanted to learn how to build something that can help with finding a good stock 
to invest in the future and that is where I want to take this project. I will continue to work on this project in the future. 
I would tell future students to try and find something that they like to build a script out of and build onto it in the future.
Honestly the most fun about this project was learning a new library that involves data and the visualization of it with matplotlib.
One of the things that made me switch majors to Computers Science was when I took stat 108 and used a graphing program so this project 
was extremely fun and entertaining.
